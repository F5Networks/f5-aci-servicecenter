Work with L2-L3 Stitching
=========================

In the top-left of L2-L3 tab, the :guilabel:`Logical Device` list filters devices based on high availability type (standalone or HA) and on device type (physical or virtual). If someone is logged in to a physical standalone BIG-IP device, the list shows only APIC logical devices of devtype :guilabel:`physical`, which have a single APIC Concrete device entry (CDEV) associated with them.

VLAN, Self IP, and Default Gateway Tasks
----------------------------------------


Create VLAN and Self IP
``````````````````````````

1. Click the L2-L3 Stitching tab.

2. From the :guilabel:`Logical Device` list, click the logical device (LDEV) that you want to perform L2-L3 stitching on (for the current BIG-IP device).

   The APIC information is displayed: Tenant, Concrete Devices and Interfaces, and Device Type (Physical/Virtual). You can also view a list of VLANs configured under the APIC Logical Device in the :guilabel:`Available` box.

3. Select one or more vlans and move them to the :guilabel:`Selected` box.

   The details of all VLANs in the selected box are displayed below. The details consist of the APIC logical interface name.

4. After selecting the VLANS click :guilabel:`Manage Selected`.

   .. note::
      - A VLAN configuration form is displayed to add VLANs and information for one or more self IPs. For VLAN, the fields to be configured are: (1) Tag (2) Interface. For self IPs, the fields to be configured are (1) Address (2) Netmask (3) Traffic-group (4) Port-lockdown.
      - Whether the interface is tagged or untagged depends on its device type. For a Physical device, VLANs are tagged and for virtual devices, VLANs are untagged. This option isn’t configurable or supported.
      - The only options available for port lockdown are All, None, and Default.
      - ACI ServiceCenter doesn’t support custom port lockdown (which is supported by BIG-IP).

5. Click :guilabel:`Submit`.

The BIG-IP device has the same VLANs configured as the APIC LDEV VLAN and L2-L3 stitching is complete.

Update VLAN and/or Self IPs
````````````````````````````

There are two options for updating VLAN/self IPs.

1. Follow the steps from the previous task and edit the values in the VLAN configuration.

   The only difference is, when you click Manage Selected, the VLAN form is pre-populated with information from the existing VLAN/self IP configuration.
   **Or**
   For VLAN edit: From L2-L3 stitching section, select the VLAN and use the :guilabel:`Edit` icon in the top right of the VLAN card.

2. For self IP edit: From the L2-L3 stitching tab, select the VLAN and use the :guilabel:`Edit` icon, located next to the self IP under Action.

Delete VLAN
````````````

1. In the top right of the VLAN card, click :guilabel:`Delete` icon.

2. When prompted, click :guilabel:`Confirm`.

The VLAN and all corresponding self IPs are deleted from the BIG-IP device, as well as from the application database.

Delete Self IPs
````````````````

1. Next to the self IP entry you want to delete on a specific VLAN card, click the :guilabel:`Delete` icon.

2. When prompted, click :guilabel:`Confirm`.

The self IP is deleted from the BIG-IP device, as well as from the application database.
   
Create Default Gateway
``````````````````````

1. Click the L2-L3 Stitching tab.

2. In the Default Gateway section, click :guilabel:`+Add Default Gateway`.

   A form is displayed.

3. In the :guilabel:`Gateway IP` field, enter the default gateway IP address. All other
   fields are disabled for user configuration, but are displayed in
   the Default Gateway form.

4. Click :guilabel:`Submit`.

The default gateway is created on the BIG-IP device and is added to the application database.

Update Default Gateway
``````````````````````

1. Click the :guilabel:`Pencil` icon besides default Gateway entry to open the default gateway form.

   The Default Gateway form opens.

2. Follow same steps as Workflow Create Default Gateway, steps 3 and 4.

Delete Default Gateway
```````````````````````

1. Next to the Default Gateway entry, click the :guilabel:`Delete` icon.

2. When prompted, confirm you want to delete the Default Gateway.

The Default Gateway is deleted from the BIG-IP device, as well as from the application database.


Sync Tasks
-----------

When you complete the following tasks, the F5 ACI ServiceCenter and BIG-IP device may become out of sync if any VLAN/self IP operations are carried out from the BIG-IP Configuration utility or CLI. If this happens, the app will detect the sync status between app data and BIG-IP data. But this feature will work only for VLAN names and self IP names that were originally created through the app, and not for other network elements with different naming conventions.

VLANs, self IPs, and default gateways that were created with a different naming convention will be detected, but the only operation allowed will be to delete them from the BIG-IP device to proceed with VLAN configuration.

Sync VLAN Data from ACI ServiceCenter to BIG-IP
```````````````````````````````````````````````

1. If there is an :guilabel:`Out-of-Sync` link on the VLAN card, click it.

   A window shows ACI ServiceCenter data and BIG-IP data (VLAN and self IP details).

2. Click :guilabel:`Sync to BIG-IP`.

For the specified VLAN, the BIG-IP has the same VLAN details as the F5 ACI ServiceCenter.

Sync VLAN Data from BIG-IP to ACI ServiceCenter
```````````````````````````````````````````````

1. If there is an :guilabel:`Out-of-Sync` link on the VLAN card, click it.

   A window shows ACI ServiceCenter data and BIG-IP data (VLAN and self IP details).

2. Click the :guilabel:`Sync to App` button.

The ACI ServiceCenter is updated to have the same VLAN details and self IPs for the specific VLAN.

Sync route data from ACI ServiceCenter to BIG-IP
````````````````````````````````````````````````

1. If there is an :guilabel:`Out-of-Sync` link on Default Gateway, click it.

   A window shows ACI ServiceCenter data and BIG-IP data (Gateway IP).

2. Click :guilabel:`Sync to BIG-IP` to sync the BIG-IP default route information to ACI ServiceCenter.

Sync route data from BIG-IP To ACI ServiceCenter
````````````````````````````````````````````````

1. If there is an :guilabel:`Out-of-Sync` link on Default Gateway, click it.

   A window shows ACI ServiceCenter data and BIG-IP data (Gateway IP).

2. Click :guilabel:`Sync to ACI ServiceCenter` to sync BIG-IP default
   route information to the ACI ServiceCenter.

Refresh L2-L3 Stitching tab
```````````````````````````

- In the top right of the L2-L3 Stitching tab, click the :guilabel:`Refresh` icon.

All the content on this tab is refreshed, including Ldevs in the LDEV list: Default Gateway, VLANs and self IPs.
