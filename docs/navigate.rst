Visibility
==========

In the F5 ACI ServiceCenter :guilabel:`Partition` list, :guilabel:`Common Partition` is selected by default. If any other partition is selected, for example the :guilabel:`Sample Partition`, the selected table shows entries that belong to both the sample partition and common partition.

View VLAN table
---------------

1. Click the Visibility tab 

   In the :guilabel:`Table` list, the VLAN table is selected by default.

2. From the :guilabel:`Partition` list, select the partition youâ€™re interested in.

   The table shows all the VLANs (vlan encaps) from the BIG-IP device that have a corresponding **Logical Device|Tenant** entry on the APIC.
   
   The table shows all the VLANs (vlan encaps) from the BIG-IP device that have a corresponding **Endpoint Group|Application Profile|Tenant** entry on the APIC. These correspond to the **Static Port VLANs** and **Static Leaf VLANs** under the aforementioned **Endpoint Group**.

   The table does not show VLANs from BIG-IPs that don't have corresponding APIC entries.
   

View VIP table
---------------

1. Click the Visibility tab, and then from the :guilabel:`Table` list, click the :guilabel:`VIP` table.

2. From the :guilabel:`Partition` list, click the partition you're interested in.

   This table shows all the VIPs (virtual servers) from the BIG-IP device. It also shows the pool and nodes for this VIP. For each node, it displays the corresponding Tenant, Application, and End Point
   Group entries from APIC.
   
   If you check the APIC GUI for the Tenant, Application, or End Point Group, you will see these node IPs under the Operational tab.

   -  If a node is not operational on the APIC, it is not displayed in the VIP table.
   -  If a pool is empty and does not have any nodes, a pool entry is not displayed in the VIP table.
   -  If a VIP does not have an assigned default pool, the VIP is not displayed in the VIP table.
   -  If any of the node members have an associated FQDN, it will be displayed in the FQDN column (Supported in v2.4+).
   -  Route domain entries are supported by the VIP table. Nodes on the BIG-IP of the form **IP%RD** will be displayed in the VIP table (Supported in v2.6+). 


View Node table
---------------

1. Click the Visibility tab, and then click the :guilabel:`Node` table from the Table list.

2. From the :guilabel:`Partition` list, click the partition.

   This table shows all the Nodes from this BIG-IP device, provided they have a corresponding Tenant Application and EPG entry on the APIC. It also displays the pools that the node belongs to. For each pool, it
   shows the corresponding VIPs (virtual servers).

   If you check the APIC GUI for the specified Tenant, Application, or End Point Group, you will see these node IPs under the Operational tab.

   -  If a specific node is not operational on the APIC, it isn't displayed in the Node table.
   -  If a pool does not have any nodes, the pool is not displayed in any of the entries in the Node table.
   -  If a VIP does not have an assigned default pool, the VIP is not displayed in any of the entries in the Node table.
   -  If any of the nodes have an associated FQDN, it will be displayed in the FQDN column (Supported in v2.4+).
   -  Route domain entries are supported by the Node table. Nodes on the BIG-IP of the form **IP%RD** will be displayed in the Node table (Supported in v2.6+).

2. In the top right of the Visibility tab, click :guilabel:`Refresh`.

The contents of the visibility table are refreshed.



Configure Telemetry
-------------------

1. To view the Virtual Server statistics on the Visibility VIP Dashboard, you must install the Telemetry Streaming plugin version 1.17 or higher on the BIG-IP device.

2. Follow the installation steps from https://clouddocs.f5.com/products/extensions/f5-telemetry-streaming/latest/installation.html

3. Configure a default pull consumer. For example: https://clouddocs.f5.com/products/extensions/f5-telemetry-streaming/latest/pull-consumers.html#pull

4. Recommended pull consumer configuration: For a scaled environment, we strongly recommend you retrieve just the Pool and Virtual Server stats from the BIG-IP. One way to filter the VIP and Pool statistics is to create a default pull consumer configuration via  a POST request to: https://<BIG_IP>/mgmt/shared/telemetry/declare

      {
          "class": "Telemetry",
          "My_Poller": {
              "class": "Telemetry_System_Poller",
              "interval": 0,
              "actions": [
                  {
                      "includeData": {},
                      "locations": {
                          "virtualServers": {
                              ".*": {}
                          },
                          "pool": {".*":{}}
                      }
                  }
              ]
          },
          "My_System": {
              "class": "Telemetry_System",
              "enable": "true",
              "systemPoller": ["My_Poller"]
          },
          "My_Pull_Consumer": {
              "class": "Telemetry_Pull_Consumer",
              "type": "default",
              "systemPoller": ["My_Poller"]
          }
      }

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
--------------------------------

**Q. Why do VLANs from the F5 ACI ServiceCenter application visibility table vanish if I destroy and re-create service graph template of my VIRTUAL Logical Device on Cisco APIC?**

For virtual ADC logical devices, if you performed the following steps: 

-  Take snapshot 

-  Delete service graph template 

-  Revert to snapshot config

The VLAN encap values associated with logical interfaces of the LDEV change and do not remain the same. The application detects this change and shows a warning on the L2-L3 stitching LDEV info page that displays VLANs. You can click the warning to update the VLAN tag. 

After a VLAN tag is updated on the BIG-IP, the visibility VLAN table starts showing the VLANs again.

------

**Q. Why don't I see all the VLANs/VIPs/Nodes from the BIG-IP in the visibility tables?**

Visibility tables display only those entries from the BIG-IP which have corresponding constructs on APIC. For example, a VLAN from the BIG-IP will only be displayed if that VLAN also belongs to some 'Tenant/App Profile/EPG' or 'Tenant/LDEV' on APIC. Similarly, a node will only be displayed if it exists as an operational endpoint in one or more of the EPGs on APIC. 

------

**Q. In Visibility tables, why don't I see Common partition entries in VLAN/VIP/Node table when I select a different partition?**

The F5 ACI ServiceCenter Visibility tables have an option to select the **Partition**. The VLAN/VIP/Node tables will only display entries from the selected partition and will not include Common partition entries (although the BIG-IP UI does provide this feature where any partition selected will also show entries from the Common partition). 

Note: This is a new behavior in FASC v2.6 and above. The previous versions do show Common partition entries along with the selected partition entries.


Visibility Dashboard
--------------------

**Q. On the Visibility Dashboard in v2.7+, why is the BIG-IP Endpoint Details section blank?**

The BIG-IP Endpoint Details section on the Visibility Dashboard may not display information due to the MAC address table getting flushed on the BIG-IP.

Workaround: Send an ARP request to the host or check the connectivity with the host using the **ping** command.

------

**Q. On the Visibility Dashboard in v2.7+, why is the 'Interface' column blank in the BIG-IP endpoint details section?**

The **Interface** column in the BIG-IP Endpoint Details section on the Visibility Dashboard will be blank for vCMP guests since the behavior of the vCMP Guest BIG-IP also is the same; i.e. no interface information for VLANs.

------

**Q. Why are the pool members displayed on Visibility VIP table, and the pool members displayed on the Visibility VIP dashboard not the same?**

The Visibility VIP table displays the pool members from a BIG-IP VIP, only if they are also present on the APIC. However, the Visibility dashboard shows all the pool members (and associated stats) that are present on the BIG-IP even if they may or may not be present on the APIC. Hence both the outputs may be different.

------

**Q. What does the field 'Route Domain' on the Visibility Dashboard indicate?**

It displays the **default route domain** for the partition to which the Virtual Server (VIP) or Node belongs.

------

**Q. Why don't I see the scrollbar for the 'View Logs' window on the Visibility Dashboard?**

If you encounter this issue, use the 'zoom out' option on your web browser. For example, on Windows, hold the **Ctrl** key, and then click **-** (the dash/minus key).
