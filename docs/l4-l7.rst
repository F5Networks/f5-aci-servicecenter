L4-L7 App Services
======================

For information on how to define a declaration, see https://clouddocs.f5.com/products/extensions/f5-appsvcs-extension/latest/userguide/.

.. note::
   When you click the L4-L7 App Service tab, two subtabs are displayed (BIG-IP and Application). The Application tab is selected by default. It has a box that displays the current AS3 declaration on this BIG-IP device.

Dry-Run declaration (BIG-IP subtab)
------------------------------------

1. The text box should include a valid AS3 declaration.

   .. note::
      You can upload a .txt or .json file instead of pasting a declaration in the text box.

2. Click :guilabel:`Dry Run`.

BIG-IP validates the JSON declaration and if it's valid, a success message appears. If it's not valid, the F5 ACI ServiceCenter displays an error message and you can fix errors and re-validate.

Submit an AS3 declaration (BIG-IP subtab)
------------------------------------------

1. The text box should include a valid AS3 declaration.

2. You can upload a .txt or .json file instead of pasting a
   declaration in the text box.

3. Click :guilabel:`Submit`.

If successful, BIG-IP includes all the partitions, applications, pools, and nodes as specified in the AS3 declaration.

.. note::

   - On clicking :guilabel:`Submit`, the resources are created asynchronously in the background. Once the resources (like partitions, applications, pools and nodes) are created successfully, the app UI loads the latest data. For more details, refer to https://clouddocs.f5.com/f5-aci-servicecenter/latest/l4-l7.html#as3-async-task-processing

AS3 Async Task Processing
-------------------------

For any configuration on the L4-L7 app services tab, all AS3 operations support asynchronous mode by default and return a success response with code 202, even if the configuration hasn’t completed yet on the BIG-IP device. Along with the 202 response, AS3 also returns a BIG-IP **task id URL** which can be used to track the pending task.

1. F5 ACI ServiceCenter tracks all pending asynchronous tasks and users can monitor them on the L4-L7 App Services tab using the **Pending Tasks** icon.

2. Click the **Pending Tasks** icon to view the list of last 20 pending AS3 tasks.

3. Once the AS3 task completes, the status gets updated against that task entry in the **Pending Tasks** table with the appropriate status code and message. The UI also loads the updated data in the L4-L7 App Services view.

.. note::
**Pending Tasks** maintains the list of tasks only for the current user session. On closing the F5 ACI ServiceCenter app, the **Pending tasks** table gets cleared.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
--------------------------------

**Q. Why is my L4-L7 Configuration tab disabled?**

For the L4-L7 configuration tab to work correctly, f5-appsvcs RPM version 3.19.1 or later is required. Installation steps are available here: https://clouddocs.f5.com/products/extensions/f5-appsvcs-extension/latest/userguide/installation.html#installation

------

**Q. Why is there a warning about "f5-appsvcs package" installation when I log in to my BIG-IP device?**

See above.

------

**Q. Why do I see error code 503 with the message "Error: Configuration operation in progress on device <BIG-IP IP>, Please try again in 2 minutes" on the 'Pending tasks' table of the app?**

If a BIG-IP is already processing an AS3 asynchronous task, it displays this message for any successive async operations. Once the asynchronous operation is completed, it is possible to perform the next operation like create/update/delete partition or application. Wait for a few minutes and try the configuration again. 

It is also possible that you may see an error message such as **'HTTPError' object has no attribute 'message'**. Wait for a few minutes and try the configuration again.

------

**Q. For all L4-L7 App Services operations, why do I see the message “BIG-IP is processing the request. Please click the 'Pending Tasks' icon to check the status of the pending request.”?**

All the L4-L7 App Services are processed in an asynchronous manner in the background. This message is displayed for every operation done on this tab. The **Pending Tasks** icon shows the status of last few such pending requests and their status. Also, once any such pending task is completed on the BIG-IP, the UI reloads the data to display the latest AS3 information about partitions and applications. 

For more details, see:  https://clouddocs.f5.com/f5-aci-servicecenter/latest/l4-l7.html#as3-async-task-processing

------

**Q. Why do I see warning signs against APIC Endpoints in View EPs table?**

It is possible that the BIG-IP's AS3 plugin is unable to sync the dynamic endpoints and create them as BIG-IP pool members due to various unsupported configurations, such as:

1. A duplicate node with the same IP as the endpoint is already present in another partition.

2. More than 60 endpoints have been added to this BIG-IP pool. AS3 currently supports only a maximum of 60 endpoints in an AS3 application pool.

3. The node IP is a substring of another node IP.

Check if you have done any unsupported configurations. For details, refer to https://clouddocs.f5.com/f5-aci-servicecenter/latest/release-notes.html#dynamic-endpoint-attach-detach

------

**Q. I deleted an application services declaration from the F5 ACI ServiceCenter application. Why do I still see partitions in the declaration?**

If your AS3 declaration contains “optimisticLockKey” mentioned explicitly, the AS3 configuration may not be deleted completely, even after multiple attempts from the application UI. However, the configuration gets removed from the BIG-IP device.

Workaround: Upload one more AS3 sample declaration to the app and then perform a :guilabel:`Delete all` operation. (Use :guilabel:`View AS3 Declaration` and click :guilabel:`Delete`.)

------

**Q. For L4-L7 App Service tab, why does the partition get deleted when I delete the last application belonging to that partition?**

If there is a single application in a particular partition, and if that application is deleted through the application, the partition that has no other applications under it will be deleted from the BIG-IP device. This is standard F5 BIG-IP behavior. You will be warned about this in the delete confirmation prompt.

------

**Q. When I create an AS3 application using the L4-L7 Application Services → Application → Basic tab, I don’t see this application listed under L4-L7 Application Services → Application → Advanced tab. How shall I view the raw JSON of this AS3 application?**

The Basic and Advanced sub-tabs of 'L4-L7 Application Services → Application' tab list only the applications created from the respective tabs. If you wish to view details (raw JSON) of any AS3 application, please go to L4-L7 Application Services → Application Inventory tab which lists all the applications. Traverse to row with the application of interest and click on the “View Application JSON” icon in the “Action” column to view the raw JSON.

------

**Q. When I create an FAST application using the L4-L7 Application Services → Application → Basic tab, can I update this application via Application Services → BIG-IP tab?**

The application created through the L4-L7 Application Services → Application → Basic tab should be updated through the same tab. If for some reason it needs to be updated via the BIG-IP tab; For example, if the virtual server address is to be updated from X to Y, then the same value needs to get updated from X to Y in the Constants → appsvcsFormData section of the application JSON from the BIG-IP tab. If the constants section is not updated, it will show inconsistent values when traversed back to Basic tab.

------

**Q. While deleting Partition OR Application using L4-L7 Application Services, why do I get the error “All objects must be removed from a partition <Partition-Name> before the partition may be removed”?**

This issue is observed when there are additional objects created under a BIG-IP Partition. In order to see if which objects are present in this partition:
1. Login to BIG-IP using ssh and as root user
2. cd to "/partitions/<Partition-Name>/" and check the contents of the file "bigip.conf"
3. This file should shows the details of the objects that you need to remove to be able to successfully delete the partition from BIG-IP

------

**Q. Why do I see 'Install f5-appscvs-templates package' warning on L4-L7 tab even though I have added FAST template plugin on BIG-IP?**

If FAST Template plugin api is unable to respond due to a REST operation failure on the BIG-IP, you may see the 'Install f5-appscvs-templates package' warning on L4-L7 UI as FASC doesnt get response from FAST. Check if restnoded and restjavad is working on the BIG-IP.

------

**Q. Why is Dynamic Endpoint Discovery not supported for default FAST template set bigip-fast-templates/?**

Dynamic Endpoint Discovery functionality is provided by F5ACIServiceCenter and hence is only supported by service_discovery/http template. (This template can be accessed from the FASC → L4-L7 App Services → Application → Basic sub-tab’s template drop-down).

------

**Q. Why are 'bigip-fast-templates/microsoft adfs' and 'bigip-fast-templates/microsoft exchange' FAST templates not working in F5 ACI ServiceCenter?**

**bigip-fast-templates/microsoft adfs** and **bigip-fast-templates/microsoft exchange** are FAST Beta Version Templates. They might not work in F5 ACI serviceCenter. Report any issues, or an RFE, on the FAST GitHub repository.

------

**Q.Pool members are not displayed if :guilabel:`shared node` option for application created using service discovery fast template is disabled afterwords**

To view pool members after share node option is disabled for an existing partition user need to sync endpoint manually to BIG-IP by Application inventory → Partition → Sync EP icon

------
