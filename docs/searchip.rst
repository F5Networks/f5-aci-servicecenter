Endpoint Search by IP
======================

F5 ACI Service Center supports searching endpoint IPs. Users can search endpoints on the BIG-IP using the following useful tools:

1. Local Endpoint Search: Present on a single BIG-IP

2. Global Endpoint Search: Across BIG-IPs which have been added to the FASC application. 

.. note:: 
  - The endpoint IP being searched should be present on both BIG-IP and APIC. If the endpoint is present on the BIG-IP and not present on the APIC, the search utility will not display that IP. If the endpoint is present on APIC but not present on any of the BIG-IPs, the search utility will not display that IP.
  - For Global Endpoint Search, the utility will search the endpoint IP only across the already logged in BIG-IPs. If any of the BIG-IPs are not logged-in, the search will not be done on those BIG-IP devices.
