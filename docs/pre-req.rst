Before You Install
==================

Before you install the F5 ACI ServiceCenter, read the following information:

- To enable and use the L4-L7 Configuration tab, use the BIG-IP Configuration utility to install the f5-appsvcs package version 3.7.0 or later on BIG-IP.
- You cannot use APIC configuration to add a logical device for BIG-IP. The F5 ACI ServiceCenter does not provide this functionality.
- For each BIG-IP device added to the ACI ServiceCenter, only one BIG-IP user can log in at a time.
- Multiple APIC admin users will see the same view of the app (the same list of BIG-IP devices with the same application data).
