Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
--------------------------------

**Q. What if I accidentally delete some log files from the logs folder /data2/logs/F5Networks_F5ACIServiceCenter on the APIC? New log files are not generated by the app.**

In order to recreate the deleted log files, disable and re-enable the application from the APIC **Apps** tab. Once the app is re-enabled, the logging should work correctly.
